Back at it again!

After taking a break from Astro to focus on basic JS, I learned what `remark & rehype` is and built a remark plugin that measures how long does a post take to read with [this Astro tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/reading-time/). I should do more with `remark & rehype` in the future.
