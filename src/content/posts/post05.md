After two weeks, I completed the tutorial version of this website! I had an amazing time and learned lots of important things in a short amount of time. I've never been happier to study. Thanks to the beginner-friendly, encouraging, step-by-step Astro tutorial I can make fully functional simple personal websites.

After that, I changed CSS to my favorite colors, improved dark mode readability, learned more about styling elements, and even imported a font. I showed it to my friends and family.

I'm excited to continue my journey with Astro! ðŸ˜Š
